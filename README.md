# Pi Site

This is a personal site filled with many inside jokes. This site is able to:
  * Advise players playing Settlers of Catan using a strangely accurate RNG
  * Send mass emails
  * Play audio files on the server side
  
This project is now discontinued and is being rewritten using ASP.NET Core 2.1 in https://github.com/cox5529/Personal-Website_.NET.
